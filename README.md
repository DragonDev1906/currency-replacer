# A Chrome Extension to convert and replaces currencies
This Chrome Extension allows you to convert Currencies displayed on any website by replacing them with another currency.

## Disclaimer
This extension will not work for all occurances. Replacing the string in a text/input field might break the website, for example. And some other situations are too problematic to find (for example `100 <span>USD</span>`).

## Currently supported currencies
- USD
- RAI
